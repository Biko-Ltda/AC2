## About the project

We chose this name for a fun fact, <b>"LHMA"</b> is the initial of the name of each member of our group, and coincidentally the junction almost forms the word <b>"LHAMA"</b>, so it makes sense with our pet shop proposal and we use a llama as a mascot and logo of our application.
Our project consists in a client registration application and login of a pet shop, there are interesting but basic features to use at the moment, an example is the user authentication to login, right after the registration.
